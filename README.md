### Purpose

This project is created as a PoC of deploying a Spring Boot app with a Gradle set up to a private repo on GCP as created by https://github.com/renaudcerrato/appengine-maven-repository

It was created by selecting a Gradle project from http://start.spring.io/ (it's bare bones without any additional dependencies added)
